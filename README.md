# List of green keywords

This dataset is created by Shuang Chen in her working paper "Green Investors and Firm Green Transition Efforts: Talk the Talk or Walk the Walk?".	

There are 764 environment-related keywords in this dataset.  They start from Wikipedia words and phrases under the tag “List of environmental organisations topics” and “List of environmental issues”. I further process them by removing words that are often used in contexts beyond environment, adding top 40 closest synonyms with a word embedding model, and finally removing words that do not express environment concerns or supports based on google search results.
