# List of green keywords

Shuang Chen creates this dataset in her following paper:	

Chen, Shuang, Green Investors and Green Transition Efforts: Talk the Talk or Walk the Walk? (June 21, 2024). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4254894 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4254894

To evaluate whether the context of a job position is eco-friendly, the most transparent method is to summarize a list of keywords whose appearances signify an eco-friendly context.

A job posting that explicitly mentions eco-friendly practices or criticizes non-eco-friendly ones strongly indicates an eco-friendly orientation. For example, when a job posting mentions "oxidizer scrubber", it suggests that the position involves work related to air pollution control or environmental compliance. While the phrase itself does not explicitly state that the position is eco-friendly, the use of these technologies is generally associated with efforts to reduce environmental impact and comply with environmental regulations.

I start compiling the green keyword list by generating a small list of seed words from Wikipedia entries under the tag "List of environmental organisations topics” and "List of environmental issues”. Each word or phrase on these two web pages has a dedicated Wikipedia page. On the one hand, they provide a comprehensive scope of important environmental topics. On the other hand, these words or phrases express environmental concerns and signify the user's supportive attitude towards environmental responsibility. I remove seed words that are often used in contexts beyond the environment, such as "Population growth" and "Agricultural subsidy", and words that are related to the environment but are too general to signify the word user's attitude towards the environment, such as "Mining" and "Coal". This leaves 294 seed words or phrases in the seed word list.

For each seed word or phrase, I use a word embedding model (details in Internet Appendix of the working paper) to select the top 40 closest synonyms. For these synonyms and seed words, I then filter out those whose Google search results do not relate to supporting eco-friendly practices or criticizing non-eco-friendly practices. Certain areas, such as nuclear energy, transition fuels, and natural gas, are controversial regarding their environmental impact. While I do not modify the National Center for O*NET Development's list of green occupations, I exclude these from the green keywords list to keep a strict eco-friendly definition. Additionally, I remove words or phrases that appear less than ten times in the analyzed job postings, as their infrequency prevents a reliable evaluation of their effectiveness in assessing the eco-friendly context of job postings. 

The final green keyword list contains 742 keywords. Internet Appendix Table A9 lists the top 120 most frequent green keywords among job postings in context-dependent green occupations.  If any of these keywords appear in a job posting, the posting is considered with an eco-friendly context.
